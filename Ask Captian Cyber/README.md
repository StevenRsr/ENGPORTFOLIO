# Ask Captain Cyber

Description of project:
Ask Captain Cyber, my senior design project, is a chatbot that combines AI and human experts to give users vetted responses to cybersecurity-related questions. This approach gives users the most reliable information. We had to design the following things to complete the project: A web Interface for User Submissions, an AI-driven response System, an Expert Vetting System, a Knowledge Base of Cybersecurity Resources, and a Scalable and Secure Platform Design. 

My role:
I did a mix of front-end design and back-end work throughout the project. This mix made my job more of an all-around helper. My work mainly consisted of looking into AI solutions and integrating them.

Skills or knowledge gained:
Some of the skills i gained would be WordPress and AI API uses. I gained experience working with WordPress to code AI plugins. While working with these plugins, I gained skills in using AI API since the plugins integrated them. 

Big picture contribution:
My big-picture contribution would be some of the webpage design and AI integration. While I can't take credit for it all, I had a significant role in implementing some of the website's aspects that help user-friendliness.

NOTE: The project is currently incomplete. Some documents will be uploaded upon completion.
