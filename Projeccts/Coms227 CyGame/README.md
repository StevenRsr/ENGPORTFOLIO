Description of project:
In this project, the task is to create a Monopoly-like board game in Java called CyGame. The game has two players moving around a circular board, landing on squares with different effects. Examples are paying the other player, gaining an extra turn, or moving additional squares. The game ends when the player can reach a certain amount of money or go bankrupt. The main objective of this project is to practice conditional logic and manage game state class interactions.
