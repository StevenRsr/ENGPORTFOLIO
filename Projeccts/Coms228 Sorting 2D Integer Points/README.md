# Sorting 2D Integer Points
Sorting 2D Integer Points

Description of project:
This project involved creating and comparing four different sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort) to find the median coordinate point from a set of 2D integer points. Each sorting algorithm is its class and inherits the abstract sorter class. This project focuses on algorithm efficiency and inheritance. 

My role:
My role in this project was Java developer. I was responsible for many things; one of the main things I did was implement all the sorting algorithms and design test cases for them. 

Skills or knowledge gained:
I gained knowledge on two main things: sorting algorithms and their efficiency. This knowledge was gained through making and testing the algorithms. Making them gave me experience, and testing them showed me how they performed efficiently.

Resources used:
Since all these algorithms were presented in class I could get by only using course resources.
