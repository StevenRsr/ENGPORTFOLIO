# Sorting 2D Integer Points
Sorting 2D Integer Points

Description of project:
This project involved creating and comparing four different sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort) to find the median coordinate point from a set of 2D integer points. Each sorting algorithm is its own class and inherits the abstract sorter class. This project focuses on algorithm efficiency and inheritance.
