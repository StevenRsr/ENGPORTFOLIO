# Archived Message Reconstruction
Archived Message Reconstruction

Description of project:
This project task is to create a Java program that decodes a compressed message using a custom binary-tree-based encoding. The program remakes a binary tree from a given encoding scheme provided in a text file and then uses this tree to decode a compressed message that was shown in the same text file back to its original form. 

My role:
My role in this project was Java developer. I was responsible for many things, from creating the MsgTree class to ensuring the program decoded the given text correctly.

Skills or knowledge gained:
One skill I gained was Binary tree construction and traversal, learned from making the functions to create the binary tree that would decode the message. Another skill I learned would be data compression, gaining first-hand experience by uncompressing the message.

Resources used:
With no skeleton code provided for this project, one of the primary resources I used was StackOverFlow to get a starting class base and to understand some of the methods that can be used for decompression. But I primarily used course material from throughout the year to complete this project
